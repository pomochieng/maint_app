application up and running.

Things you are required to complete and made functional after the project is complete:

****As an admin

1. I should be able to view all maintenance / repairs requests
2. I should be able to add names and contacts (phone number) for the people doing maintenance.
3. Once maintenance is done, I should be able to mark it as resolved
4. I should be able to approve/reject a repair/maintenance request, and provide comments.
5. I should send the staff an email confirming if the maintenance request was resolved as intended (Are you satisfied with the repair/maintenance done)
6. I should give the maintenance timeline for completing the maintenance task.
7. I should add documentation describing how a maintenance or repair was done.
